#LJ Code 201 - Day 6

Today I learn Functions, Objects, and methods. Function has key-value pair. Key is another word for name. Object has property and method is function belong to an object. Also we learn about Document Object Model (DOM) and DOM tree. Through DOM we can access to elements in HTML and manipulate them.

Learning Function and Object wasn't super-hard for me but DOM has made me confused somehow. My main focus now is understanding DOM and mastering it.

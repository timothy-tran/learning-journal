#LJ Code 201 - Day 13

The subject we learned is the localStorage. With localStorage, we can move from webpage to webpage and still able to keep the data. This called Data Persistence. localStorage is operated as key-value pair. We get to the value by the key name. It stored data as a string, therefore we use JSON.stringify() to put it up to localStorage and JSON.parse() to get back the value. This will keep the integrity of the number type data. We use localStorage.clear() to delete all data in localStorage.

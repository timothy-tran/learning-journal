#LJ Code 201 - Day 5

It is day 5 and we have cover a lot more topic in HTML and CSS. We learn how to include image in web page, and we also learn to style text and color. We learn new commands for git: Git branch and Git checkout.

What we have been learning so far, the IF -- ELSE condition and looping were not that hard for me. The HTML and CSS are the thing I need to focus more on.

I did first deployment of my webpage in Github with gh-pages.

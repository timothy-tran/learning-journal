#LJ-code201-day15

This is the last day of instruction for code 201. We have gone a long way. Today we learn some of the things we'll learn in code 301. And we practice workflow and resolve git conflict. We also start working on our project. This is the opportunity for us to put in practice what we have learn. I am looking forward to it.

#LJ Code 201 - Day 1

Today is the first day of the Code 201. I was excited to learn new things through this class. The instructore, Nick, is very nice but he talks really fast. I am not used to it and missed a few points. But I caught up with the class afterward. After the orientation and instroduction, Nick went over the set up of the laptop and the command line commands. We also learned about version control such as Git and Github. We reviewed the basic of HTML and JavaScript.

I have a flu for the first day of the class so I was a little slow. But I think every is going to be Ok and I hope this class is going to be successful because I'm going to work hard for it.

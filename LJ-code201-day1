#LJ Code 201 - Day 2

This is the third day of the class. We went over a lot of stuff. We learn Git and how branch out. However I am still not getting the topic very clear. I need to learn more about this. The class is moving fast now, so far the materials cover in class is still manageable to me except Git, because I have done reading before class begin. The things I need to do now is:
- Get over the flu and recover from the cough.
- Go over Git and Github from the basic.
- Get back on top of materials will be cover in class.

#LJ Code 201 - Day 20

Today is the project presentation day. All five teams have presented the project they worked on during the week. Each team has its own difficulty. Some teams were heavy on the HTML and CSS, other teams were more involved with JavaScript. I learned that through the project, most of us have gained the hand on experiences what we have learned in the class.

#LJ Code 201 - Day 8

Today I learned about form in HTML and how it is used. The form is inside a form element in the body of the HTML. Form is used to collect information from users. Information in a form is a name/value pair. I also learned about event and how JavaScript handle the event. An event is an action such as user click on a button or a webpage is finished loading. We can use JavaScript to collect information and process it.

#LJ Code 201 - Day 11

Today topic we've learned is about including videos in webpages. This topic is seem simple enough to me, but who knows. There are some topics look easy to me but there are topics that is hard. For example, I am still trying to get down the concept of the communication protocol between JS and HTML. This is one area I have to overcome in this class.
